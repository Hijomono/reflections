What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A git directory is created to create commits that save the status of the files in the repository at a given time.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It allows you to choose which files' status you'll add to a commit.
