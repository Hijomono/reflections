When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working from more than one computer or when i want others to be able to acces my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because i may not be the one in control of the remote repository
